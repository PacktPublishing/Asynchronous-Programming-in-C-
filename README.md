**Build blazing-fast software with multithreading and asynchronous programming for ultimate efficiency**

## What is this book about?
As hardware advancements continue to accelerate, bringing greater memory capacity and more CPU cores, software must evolve to adapt to efficiently use all available resources and reduce idle CPU cycles. 
In this book, two seasoned software engineers with about five decades of combined experience will teach you how to implement concurrent and asynchronous solutions in C++.

* Explore the different parallel paradigms and know when to apply them
* Acquire deep knowledge of thread management and safety mechanisms
* Understand asynchronous programming in C++, including coroutines
* Leverage network asynchronous programming by using Boost.Asio and Boost.Cobalt
* Add proven performance and optimization techniques to your toolbox
* Find out how to test and debug asynchronous software

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int main() {
     std::thread t1([]() {
          for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
               std::cout << "1 " << "2 " << "3 " << "4 "
                         << std::endl;
          }
     });
```
